# MyStore

This is the capstone project of Udacity's Full Stack JavaScript Nanodegree.
It showcases basic Angular usage in the example of a web-store. 

It features following functionality:

- Shows a list of products (either from provided .json or API connection)
- Shows a product details view when clicked on product
- Add products to cart, remove them there and checkout the order
  
Additional functionality if you connect this project to the previous Nanodegree API project [Storefront Backend](https://github.com/SteveOverSea/Storefront-Backend). 

- Login as a user and have access to a userpage to show your orders
- Create a new user, if the credentials don't find an existing one
- Login as admin to remove or add products to the store
